# search-page-angular-2
Sample search page done in angular 2. This project was to practice and showcase some work I've done with angular 2 to potential employers.

## To run project
clone repository or download code to your machine.

using `npm install` install node_modules needed for the application to run. After all dependencies have been downloaded `npm start` will build and watch files for changes as well as run application to view.


## Things to do
This code originally came from the quick-start available on Angular's website. So it does include items like testing and e2e test using protractor that are on a todo list to continue showcasing all skils around angular develop life cycle.

+ Fix e2e test to properly test html that is on page.
+ Fix unit test to test service, and component of angular application.
